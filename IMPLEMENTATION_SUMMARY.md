# New 4-Layer Registration Flow - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a new 4-layer registration flow that intelligently handles both new user registration and existing user login based on email verification.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New Validation Schemas (src/validations/auth.validation.js)
- `checkEmail` - Validates email input for checking user existence
- `createUserCredentials` - Validates email, OTP, password, and role for credential creation
- Updated `sendOTP` and `verifyOTP` to support `"registration"` type

### 2. New Service Functions (src/services/auth.service.js)
- `checkEmail(email)` - Checks if a user exists with the given email
  - Returns: `{ exists: true/false, message: string }`
  
- `sendRegistrationOTP(email)` - Sends OTP for new user registration
  - Creates a temporary user with a temp password
  - Sends OTP via email
  - Returns: `{ message: string, tempUserId: string }`
  
- `createUserCredentials(userData)` - Creates user credentials after OTP verification
  - Verifies OTP
  - Updates temporary user with real password and role
  - Returns: `{ message, userId, email, role }`

### 3. New Controller Functions (src/controllers/auth.controller.js)
- `checkEmailController` - Handles email existence check requests
- `createUserCredentialsController` - Handles credential creation requests
- Updated `sendOTP` controller to handle `type: "registration"`
- Updated `verifyOTPCode` controller to handle `type: "registration"`

### 4. New Routes (src/routes/v1/auth.route.js)
- `POST /api/v1/auth/check-email` - Check if email exists
- `POST /api/v1/auth/create-user-credentials` - Create user credentials

### 5. Documentation
- Created `NEW_REGISTRATION_FLOW_API_DOCUMENTATION.md` with complete API documentation
  - Flow diagrams
  - Endpoint specifications
  - Request/response examples
  - Error codes
  - Security features
  - Frontend integration guide

## Registration Flow

### For New Users (5 Steps):
1. **Check Email** → `POST /auth/check-email` with email
2. **Send OTP** → `POST /auth/send-otp` with `{ email, type: "registration" }`
3. **Verify OTP** → `POST /auth/verify-otp` with `{ email, otp, type: "registration" }`
4. **Create Credentials** → `POST /auth/create-user-credentials` with `{ email, otp, password, role }`
5. **Complete Profile** → `POST /auth/complete-registration-profile` with profile data

### For Existing Users (2 Steps):
1. **Check Email** → `POST /auth/check-email` with email → Returns `exists: true`
2. **Login** → `POST /auth/login` with `{ email, password }`

## Key Features

### Smart Email Checking
- The system first checks if the email exists
- Routes users to appropriate flow (registration vs login)
- Improves user experience by guiding them to the right path

### Temporary User Creation
- For new registrations, a temporary user is created during Step 2 (Send OTP)
- The user is created with a temporary password
- In Step 4 (Create Credentials), the temporary password is replaced with the real one
- This approach ensures OTP can be stored and verified properly

### OTP Handling
- Registration OTPs use the same infrastructure as email verification OTPs
- OTPs are stored in the Token collection with proper expiration
- Rate limiting and attempt limits apply to registration OTPs

### Profile Completion
- After credentials are created, users must complete their profile
- Profile includes: name, contactNumber, cityofInterest
- Additional fields required for agent role
- Upon completion, user receives auth tokens and can access the system

## Technical Implementation Details

### Error Handling
- Proper error codes and messages
- Validation at each step
- Prevents duplicate registrations
- Handles illegitimate OTP attempts

### Security Measures
- OTP expiration (10 minutes)
- Rate limiting (3 requests per 15 minutes)
- OTP attempt limits (5 attempts per OTP)
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token authentication
- OTP blacklisting after verification

### Database Changes
- No schema changes required
- Uses existing User model
- Uses existing Token collection
- Leverages existing `registrationStatus` field

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with new user email
2. Test with existing user email
3. Test OTP expiration
4. Test OTP attempt limits
5. Test rate limiting
6. Test with agent role
7. Test profile completion
8. Test error scenarios

## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- Old registration endpoints still work
- `POST /auth/register-with-otp` - Still functional
- `POST /auth/verify-registration-otp` - Still functional
- `POST /auth/complete-registration-profile` - Still functional

### Frontend Integration
Frontend should:
1. Start with email input screen
2. Call `/auth/check-email`
3. Based on response, show either:
   - Login screen (if exists)
   - Registration flow (if new)
4. Follow the appropriate flow based on user type

## Files Modified

1. `src/validations/auth.validation.js` - Added new validation schemas
2. `src/services/auth.service.js` - Added new service functions
3. `src/controllers/auth.controller.js` - Added new controllers and updated existing ones
4. `src/routes/v1/auth.route.js` - Added new routes
5. `NEW_REGISTRATION_FLOW_API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Created comprehensive documentation
6. `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Next Steps

1. Test the complete flow end-to-end
2. Update frontend to use new endpoints
3. Consider deprecating old endpoints (optional)
4. Monitor OTP usage and adjust rate limits if needed
5. Consider adding analytics for registration completion rates
